        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Thomas Vincent Traczyk V. I am a second-year student at the University of California Riverside majoring in Business Administration concentrating in Accounting. I would like to say that I think I am involved in my school. I am currently the Vice President of Internal Affairs for the Accounting Society and I plan to further my commitment to this club until the day I graduate. My personal goal within this club is to become President one day and I believe I am still on track with that goal. As the Vice President of Internal Affairs for the Accounting Society, my role in the club is to manage the interaction between members of the club and the club itself, through email. I also keep in touch with Professional Accountants who are actively recruiting, and I invite them as guest speakers to our bi-monthly meetings. I keep in touch with the Professional Accountants and invite them to our biggest event of the year: The Spring Banquet. This event is a very professional dinner setting where students who are majoring in Accounting have the opportunity to communicate with Professional Accountants. This event is recruiter heavy, as a lot of students get hired through this important event. 

I do not have any current professional experience other than being the Vice President of Internal Affairs for the Accounting Society, but I am always looking to improve my personal skills to set myself up to become qualified as an Accountant. I am currently seeking an internship to get a more hands-on approach to accounting rather than learning only from classes. 

As a student, I recently got accepted to the University of California Riverside School of Business for next quarter (Winter Quarter 2020). I am only a Sophomore getting into the school of business, but this will enable me to take more classes pertaining to my major and make myself qualified for an internship with the rigorous Accounting courses I plan to take at an early stage on my college years. I do not plan to graduate early either. I plan to take all of the Upper Division Accounting Courses University of California Riverside offers before I graduate. Since I am ahead of schedule compared to the average second year, I have the opportunity for personal growth in Accounting with more classes of different areas of this field. 

I believe I have great interpersonal skills as a leader. Growing up, I have played soccer for 14 years. I was always the captain of my soccer teams. Being captain really taught me how to lead in certain ways such as how to communicate with people in your team, how to demonstrate to others, and most importantly, how to inspire people. I have developed a winning attitude from my experience in soccer and it has really taught me a lot in life to make me who I am today. Soccer has also taught me to not take anything for granted in life. I have suffered major injuries in soccer and it made me realize that I should be thankful for playing the beautiful sport and play every game like it is my last.
